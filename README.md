This project illustrate a high-level data warehouse architecture using a three-layered structure (Bronze, Silver, and Gold), optimized for analytics and reporting:

1. Bronze Layer: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database.
2. Silver Layer: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.
3. Gold Layer: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.
